Hello world!  

My name is Ryan Cooper and the posts that (hopefully) follow this one will be my way of expressing myself online in a way that wouldn't quite fit on a LinkedIn profile or Twitter feed.  This first post will be me telling you things that I know about myself, and the rest will be me filling in the gaps.  

I know that I'm a third year Industrial Engineering Student at Georgia Tech.  I know that I love to read, watch anime, and binge adventure shows (currently sprinting through Steven Universe and loving every second of it).  I also know that I love sports and animals (except chickens...they don't count), especially basketball and dogs.  I know that I love helping people, I believe that all love is beautiful, and I believe that Black Lives Matter.

Now for the things I don't know...as sort of a preview of what's to come.  No se hablar frances o espa√±ol.  I don't know the best way for me to thrive academically for two semesters at a time.  I don't know how to balance my coursework with my personal growth.  I don't know the career I want to pursue.  I don't know what I want my legacy to be.  I don't know what I want for breakfast in the morning.

But my hope is that as these things become more apparent to me I become able to paint a better, more vivid picture of myself to you.  And that we both grow in the process.


PS. 

		They say to end these things with a joke, so I'll drop the headshot from my freshman year here for us to all chuckle at.
