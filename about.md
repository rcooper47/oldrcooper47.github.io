Hello!   

My name is Ryan Cooper and I am a rising third year Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech.  I am passionate about learning, growing, and helping others do the same.  I like to stay busy by reading, finding new problems to solve, or watching a show or anime.  As of 7/29/19 this page is a work in progress and will hopefully be updated by the next time you visit.

### More Information

I'm currently working on the content that will go here.
